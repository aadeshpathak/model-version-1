MOBILE UI REFACTORING CHANGELOG
===============================

Date: October 1, 2025
Objective: Refactor mobile view (≤md breakpoint) to behave like a modern native Android app

CHANGES MADE:
=============

1. **CSS & Global Styles**
   - Added mobile-specific CSS in src/App.css to prevent horizontal overflow on mobile
   - Added @media (max-width: 767px) { html, body, #root { overflow-x: hidden; } }

2. **Mobile Components Created**
   - src/components/mobile/MobileLayout.tsx - App wrapper for mobile-only UI with safe area padding
   - src/components/mobile/MobileBottomNav.tsx - Fixed bottom navigation with 5 tabs (Home, Bills, Payments, Notices, Profile)
   - src/components/mobile/MobileHeader.tsx - Top header with logo, title, and hamburger menu
   - src/components/ui/MobileCard.tsx - Reusable mobile card component with neumorphism styling

3. **Login Form Modifications**
   - Added mobile-specific landing page variant in src/components/LoginForm.tsx
   - Mobile landing shows compact hero with feature pills and CTA
   - Desktop landing remains unchanged

4. **Dashboard Modifications**
   - src/components/MemberDashboard.tsx - Added mobile-only view with stacked cards, responsive charts
   - src/components/AdminDashboard.tsx - Added mobile-only view with stacked cards, responsive charts
   - Both dashboards use MobileLayout wrapper on mobile

5. **Chart Responsiveness**
   - All charts now use ResponsiveContainer with width="100%" and appropriate heights
   - Charts are fully responsive and fit mobile screens without overflow

6. **Environment Variables**
   - Updated src/lib/firebase.ts to use environment variables for Firebase config
   - Added .env file with Firebase configuration
   - Updated .gitignore to exclude .env file

7. **Safe Area Support**
   - Added safe area padding using env(safe-area-inset-bottom) in mobile components
   - Bottom navigation and layout respect device safe areas

8. **Animations & Micro-interactions**
   - Added Framer Motion animations for page transitions and tap effects
   - Cards have scale animations on tap
   - Smooth fade-in animations for content loading

9. **Accessibility Improvements**
   - Added proper ARIA labels for navigation elements
   - Role attributes for tab navigation
   - Focus outlines for keyboard navigation

10. **Touch Target Optimization**
    - Minimum 44px touch targets for buttons and interactive elements
    - Proper spacing between interactive elements

===============
- src/App.css (added mobile overflow CSS)
- src/lib/firebase.ts (environment variables)

- All touch targets meet 44px minimum
- Safe area padding works on devices with notches

COMPATIBILITY:
==============

- Mobile views only visible on screens ≤md breakpoint (768px)

PERFORMANCE:
============
- Lazy loading of mobile components
- Optimized animations with Framer Motion
- Efficient re-renders with proper React patterns
