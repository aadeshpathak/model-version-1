# Society Management App Context

## Current Setup
- **Tech Stack**: React (TypeScript), Vite, shadcn/ui, Tailwind CSS, Firebase (Auth + Firestore).

- **Database**: Firestore with collections: users (role, approved, dismissed, bannedUntil, fullName, phone, flatNumber, lastLogin), bills (status, payment tracking), expenses, notices (target, readBy).
- **Real-time**: onSnapshot for live data sync across all components with instant updates.
- **Mobile Responsive**: Professional mobile-first design with sidebar-to-navbar conversion, hamburger menu, and touch-optimized interface.
- **UI Enhancements**: Advanced animations, hover effects, gradient shifts, smooth transitions, and professional styling.
- **Files Modified**:
  - src/components/LoginForm.tsx: Dual-mode login ("Login" vs "Request to Join") with approval workflow.

## Current Status
The app is fully functional with professional UI/UX, mobile responsiveness, real-time updates, and complete approval workflow. All syntax errors have been resolved and the development server is running successfully on http://localhost:8081. All major features are implemented and tested.
