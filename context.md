  - Download from: https://nodejs.org/
  - Verify installation: `node --version` and `npm --version`
- **Git**: For cloning the repository
  - Download from: https://git-scm.com/
- **Code Editor**: VS Code recommended with TypeScript and React extensions

### Step-by-Step Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aadeshpathak/model-version-1.git
   cd model-version-1
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   This will install all required packages including React, Vite, Firebase, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, Framer Motion, etc.

3. **Set Up Firebase Project**
   - Go to https://console.firebase.google.com/
   - Create a new project (or use existing)
   - Enable Authentication with Email/Password provider
   - Enable Firestore Database
   - Go to Project Settings > General > Your apps > Add Web App
   - Copy the Firebase config object

4. **Create Environment Variables**
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory
   - Add your Firebase configuration:
   ```env
   VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project.firebaseapp.com
   VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
   VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project.appspot.com
   VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
   VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
   VITE_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=your_measurement_id
   ```

5. **Set Up Firestore Security Rules**
   - In Firebase Console > Firestore Database > Rules
   - Replace with the content from `firestore.rules` in the project

6. **Create Admin User**
   - In Firebase Console > Authentication > Users
   - Add user: admin@gmail.com with password: admin@1234
   - In Firestore > users collection, add document with ID matching the admin's UID:
   ```json
   {
     "email": "admin@gmail.com",
     "role": "admin",
     "approved": true,
     "dismissed": false,
     "createdAt": "current_timestamp"
   }
   ```

7. **Start Development Server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   - Server will start on http://localhost:5173 (default Vite port)
   - Open in browser and test with admin@gmail.com / admin@1234

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

- **Port 5173 already in use**: Change port with `npm run dev -- --port 3000`
- **Firebase connection errors**: Check .env file and Firebase project settings
- **Build errors**: Ensure Node.js version is 18+ and run `npm install` again
- **TypeScript errors**: Install VS Code TypeScript extension
- **Mobile testing**: Use browser dev tools or ngrok for mobile device testing
